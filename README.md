# Simple-Search-Enginer

## Description
Modify the previous program. At this stage, you need to add a user menu.

The menu should display the following actions:

1. Search information.
2. Print all data.
0. Exit.
The user must select a menu item and then enter data if necessary. Your program must not stop until the corresponding option (the exit option) is chosen.

Decompose the program into separate methods to make it easy to understand and add to or edit later.
