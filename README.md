## Description
Modify the program. The program should read data from a text file instead of the standard input. The file structure depends on your textâ€™s meaning (personal information, building information, book information, and so on). See an example below.

The program must process the command line argument --data, and after that, the name of the file with the data, for example, --data text.txt.

Note that the file should not include the total number of lines. All lines must be read only once, at the start of your program.

Here is an example of a line. It contains three items: first name, last name, and email of a person.
